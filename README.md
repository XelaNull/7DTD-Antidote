# QUEST TEXT:

## Starter Quest

After the Zombie Apocalypse, the doctors of the World Health Organization (WHO) did flyer drops around the infected area asking for the assistance of any survivors in crafting a serum. The serum is needed to ultimately create an antidote. This quest starter item (a post-in note) should be spread around the world as a random drop in trash. This quest should instruct the player to locate airdrops for further instructions.

## Chem Station Fragments (5) Questline

These five fragments should drop only through airdrops and should be fairly rare, requiring the player to loot at least 20 airdrops to obtain the five pieces. Each fragment must be translated at workbench to create "Decoded Antidote Station 1" type item. This item, once "read" starts the next quest that tells them to seek out "Antidote Station Fragment 2", which requires translation at a workbench to create "Decoded Antidote Station 2". The fifth piece, once decoded on the workbench, should give the player the schematic to craft the Antidote Station, and also to start the SERUM Fragments quest below. This chained questline gives us opportunity to present quest text to tell the story for each fragment.

### "Decoded Antidote Station 1" QUEST TEXT:

WHO has been monitoring the outbreak of the Zombie infection and has noticed the Zombies seem to be getting stronger over time. They are feverishly working to develop a platform by which a serum, and later an antidote can be crafted. But they are hampered by needing items that can only be found in the infected zone. So they are using Air drops to provide the schematics so survivors can create their own antidote station. But these schematics are being developed all over the world, so the different pieces need to be assembled together to create the full schematic. Collect all five schematic fragments and decode them to craft the Antidote Station.

### "Decoded Antidote Station 5" QUEST TEXT:

## SERUM Fragments (3)

This should be three different schematics that are rare drops via the Airdrop. This quest should instruct the player that there are three schematics to gather. The three schematics are:

- Diamond Coated Jar
- Zombocilyn
- SERUM

Once the three schematics are crafted, an ANTIDOTE quest-starting item should be rewarded that tells the player that they next need to gather four more schematics from Airdrops to learn how to craft the Antidote:

## ANTIDOTE Fragments (4)

This should be four different schematics that are rare drops via the Airdrop. Only once they've gathered all four schematics will they learn how to craft the antidote:

- Sterilized water
- Natura Tea
- Berry Juice
- 7dtd ANTIDOTE
